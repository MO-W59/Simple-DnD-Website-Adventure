# Simple-DnD-Website-Adventure
This small website has a neat little DnD adventure with some maps, and features simple login, logout and loging functions.

To run you will need to set the flask app to run chorn_loith_site.py and then proceed to localhost:5000 in your browser.

To see the DnD combat maps you will need to create a valid user and login.
